Practice Work 7 of Web Programming Languages:
We had to use Flickr's api to display top 100 pictures that were searched using a certain keyword. 
And the pictures had to be in thumbnail format. The thumbnails had to be a link such that clicking on them gave the full image sizes.
A good source for the api is this:https://www.web-development-blog.com/archives/flickr-photo-search-api/
I essentially used the flickr's php class and wrote another php class which interfaced with this api and did the essential functionalities.
